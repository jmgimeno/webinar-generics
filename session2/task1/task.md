## Inequalities

This session has been devoted to writing our own generic functions.
We ask you now to write the converse of equality, a generic inequality check.
We have left holes in the implementation, including not only function code,
but also class constraints to be filled in.

Before proceeding with the rest, we strongly advise to fix
the type signature for `gneq` as first goal. Otherwise the
error messages may not be informative due to the dependency
with that type.
