## Getting started

#### Welcome to the 47 Degrees Academy IDE! 

In order to make your setup ready for exercises, you need
to take a few more steps:

1. In the main menu, select _File_ and then _Project Structure_.
2. In the _Project_ tab, change the _Project SDK_ to the last option under _Detected SDKs_. Once selected it should appear _Haskell Tool Stack_, and click _OK_.
3. In the main menu, select _Haskell_ and then _Update Settings and restart REPLs_.
4. The rest of your Haskell environment is then configured.
This can take up to **15 minutes**.
You should wait until there is no activity in the IDE.
You can check whether there is something running by looking
at the bottom right corner of the window: a progress bar
or a message _N processes running_ means there is.
5. In the main menu, select _File_ and then _Invalidate Caches / Restart..._.
Click _Just Restart_, the IDE shall close and start again.
6. Wait again until there is no activity in the IDE.
As before, the process can take up to **15 minutes**.

After that, try to do this first exercise. Your answer should
replace what is written in the grey boxes. If you click _Check_
without changing anything, the IDE should indicate that the answer
is wrong. Once you write the right one, checking should give you
a green tick.
